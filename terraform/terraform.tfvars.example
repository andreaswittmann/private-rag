# Notes:
# - Replace YOUR_IP with your actual public IP address
# - Generate SSH key pair with: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
# - Get your public IP with: curl -s https://checkip.amazonaws.com/
# - For open access (not recommended), use "0.0.0.0/0" for allowed_ip and ssh_cidr_blocks
